# Dashboard

This is a homepage of a dashboard. I have included all my completed projects in here to act as my temporary portfolio. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). <br>

# Things I Learned

- Deep understanding on when to use flex, grid, and table when layouting.
- How to create a responsive webpage using fr unit and grid.
- Improved layout and color palette designing.
- How to insert icons from fa and google fonts.

# Future Improvements

- I, who have the admin access, will be able to easily add and store future projects in here just by clicking an add button. Currently I need to manually add it to the html file.
- Add a search function using the name of the tool and a filter combo box based on the technologies related to the tool.
