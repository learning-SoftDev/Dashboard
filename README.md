This is a homepage of a dashboard. I have included all my completed projects in here to act as my portfolio. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). <br>

Things I learned:<br>

- Deep understanding on when to use flex, grid, and table when layouting.<br>
- How to create a responsive webpage using fr unit and grid<br>
- Improved layout and color palette designing<br>
- How to insert icons from fa and google fonts<br>
